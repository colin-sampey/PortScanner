This is a Port Scanner

It uses mainly the scoket library, a built in library with Python.
I wanted to use socket over nmap to try building something that's more basic but also only using what python offers.
I faced some challenges on testing it and getting the host to work, but I'm hoping to add subnetting to it in the future so it can find the host itself, without user input. I'm hoping to add a lot more to this.

This was a personal project, mainly for self-education on an introduction into how network administration works.
